> Hi, I want to know how can I install Singularity and SAW without root?  
> If root is necessary, maybe developing a version without root, just like spaceranger or cellranger of 10 Ã—, is easier use.  
> Thanks!

### Resolution
**Comment by @Clouate (Collaborator) on Jun 27, 2022**:
> Hi, @tyyl622, you can try to install Singularity without root like this:  
> `./mconfig --without-suid --prefix=$PATH_YOU_WANT_TO_INSTALL` .  
> And SAW is a package executed by Singularity, root is not necessary.
