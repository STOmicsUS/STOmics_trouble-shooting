# Stereo-seq Troubleshooting and Additional Resources

The Stereo-seq Analysis Workflow (SAW) software suite consists of a comprehensive set of pipelines designed to process sequencing data from Stereo-seq, generating spatial gene expression matrices for downstream analysis. This repository is dedicated to offering solutions to common issues, additional resources, and comprehensive guides related to SAW, StereoMap, and supporting sowftware.

This repository is designed to be a supplementary resource to the [main SAW documentation](https://github.com/STOmics/SAW), [StereoMap documentation](https://www.stomics.tech/helpcenter/usermanual/E.Project/F.Tool/C.StereoMap.html#gene-protein-panel), and [Stereopy documentation](https://stereopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). **Please refer to the main documentations for detailed setup and use guides**.

## ‚≠êNew SAW v8 Update

The SAW v8 update introduces major changes, including a self-contained format, integrated pipelines, and support for FFPE samples and microorganism analysis. Key updates include:

- **Self-Contained Format:** Download and unpack the new tar.gz package‚Äîno additional environment configuration needed.
- **Integrated Pipelines:** Simplified workflows with commands like `SAW count` and `SAW makeRef`.
- **FFPE & Microorganism Support:** Expanded analysis capabilities for FFPE samples and microorganism data.

For detailed information on these updates, please refer to the [SAW v8 Overview](./SAW_v8.md).

If you encounter any problems, please [report them](https://github.com/STOmicsUS/STOmics_trouble-shooting/issues/new/choose) so we can continue to improve the software!
