# SAW: Stereo-seq Troubleshooting and Additional Resources

The Stereo-seq Analysis Workflow (SAW) software suite consists of a comprehensive set of pipelines designed to process sequencing data from Stereo-seq, generating spatial gene expression matrices for downstream analysis. This repository is dedicated to offering solutions to common issues, additional resources, and valuable materials related to SAW.

This is designed to be a supplementary resource to the [main SAW documentation](https://github.com/STOmics/SAW). **Please refer to the main documentation for a detailed setup and use guide**.

## ‚ùìFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Please refer to our *FAQs*, which have been compiled from community contributions and categorized according to common issues:

- [Setup/Installation](./setup_installation/setup_installation_FAQ.md)
- [SAW modules](./SAW_modules/SAW_modules_FAQ.md)
- [File Formats](./file_formats/file_formats_FAQ.md)
- [Downstream Analysis](./downstream_analysis/downstream_analysis_FAQ.md)
- [Docker/Singularity/ImageStudio](./docker_singularity_imagestudio/docker_singularity_imagestudio_FAQ.md)

If you can't find a solution, please feel free to [report the bug or ask a question](https://github.com/STOmicsUS/STOmics_trouble-shooting/issues/new/choose).

## üìñ Additional Resources
We have compiled a list of **Additional Resources** to help you get started and deepen your understanding.

- [Media Materials](./media/) - collection of videos showing how to use various modules in SAW.
- [File Formats](./file_formats/) - detailed information on the file formats used in SAW (GEM, GEF, rds, etc.).
- [Docker/Singularity](./docker_singularity_imagestudio/) - guides on how to use Docker and Singularity containers.
- [Downstream Analysis](./downstream_and_segmentation/) - guides on how to perform downstream analysis using StereoMap and more using SAW-generated data.
